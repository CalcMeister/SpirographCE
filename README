#####################################################################################

Enjoy the timeless fun of the renowned Spirograph toy right within your calculator!
Handles three colors and graphs at once to replicate the original Spirograph.
Uses intelligent Tstep design (Idea by Jacobly) to keep graphs from repeating.
Save your Spirographs in Picvars!
Retains previous graph info using a Graph Database

***Please note that this program does not graph as fast as other graphs you may be
   used to, so please be patient, it’s trying its best!

Menu help:
	EDIT RED:
		Edits the attributes of the red pen spirograph.
		When prompted for number of teeth on the inner gear,
		note that the higher the lcm of the outer gear and inner
		gear, the longer it will take to draw. (the outer gear will
		always have 120 teeth)
	EDIT GREEN:
		Same as Edit Red except for the green pen.
	EDIT BLUE:
		You get the idea.
	CLEAR ALL:
		Erases all spirograph data so you can start from scratch.
	DRAW SPIROGRAPH:
		Draws all created spirographs. If you haven't edited any,
		then the screen will be blank.
		DRAW DENSITY:
			Speedy is quick but draws longer segments, making the
			Spirograph look less precise but take a short time to
			draw. Standard is a good equilibrium between speed
			and precision. High is good for times when you aren’t
			in a rush and can wait a minute for a stunning design.
			Very High is good for when you have hella time to waste.
		The program will estimate the seconds it thinks the calculator
		will take per graph to display your graph.
	SAVE AS PICVAR:
		Choose a Picvar slot to save your Spirograph
	CREDITS:
		Displays credits.
	EXIT:
		Exits the program, retaining all graph information you
		had before you started the program using a GDB.
